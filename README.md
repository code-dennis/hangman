# Hangman in Python 3.12

This hangman project showcases how to use collections and functions to create more readable and better performing Python code.

The project contains three versions of the hangman game that can all be played in the python console.
  1) The file week123.py contains a version of hangman that contains only basic variables, loops and conditions.
  2) week56.py expands on the week123 version by introducing simple collections and functions.
  3) week7.py concludes the showcase by adding complex collections and functions.

The main.py file is a copy of week123.py. 
Here you can experiment with collections and functions all you want.

If the code breaks and you don't know how to fix it anymore,
You can simply start over by copying the code from week123.py to main.py.

In the roadmap file you can see the steps that the code consists of.
See the challenge file for more challenges once you got the hang of functions and collections.

Good luck and have fun!
